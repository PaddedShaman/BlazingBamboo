# Blazing Bamboo

Blazing bamboo is a fiery bamboo species endemic to the crimson forests of the Nether, but adapts readily to a variety of stone and dry soils across all dimensions. Approach it with caution: the living plants glow with heat and deal fire damage to creatures that get too close. It quickly dies in the rain or near water, and dead bamboo plants drop gunpowder when broken.

* Peaceful renewable source of blaze rods and gunpowder
* Strong renewable fuel source that can be fully automated
* Lava rafts for safe passage across lava, like lava boats!
* An expanded set of decorative blocks
* All blocks are fire-proof, lava-proof, and ghast-proof!
* All items are fire-resistant
